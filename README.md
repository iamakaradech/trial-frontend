# Question #1 - Warm up
We give you a JSON array like this:
```
[
{ "name": "rick", "cars": ["Corvette Z06", "Lotus Exite S"] },
{ "name": "john", "cars": ["BMW 320D"] },
{ "name": "zing", "cars": ["Honda Jazz", "Honda Click", "Honda Waves"] }
]
```

We want you to create function that process this json array and print out the results:
```
John want to buy BMW 320D
Rick want to buy Corvette Z06, Lotus Exite S
Zing want to buy Honda Jazz, Honda Click, Honda Waves
Note: please careful the order and capitalize of name!
